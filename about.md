**Secure Embedded Linux and Real-Time Firmware** | **Edge & IIoT Gateways** | **Rust & Modern C++**

I'm Paweł, a senior embedded software engineer who leads development of critical system components.

I've spearheaded implementations for secure embedded systems operating in challenging environments—spanning transportation telematics, automotive gateways, medical devices, and telecommunications infrastructure. Through technical leadership on key projects, I've established development practices that prioritize security, reliability, and long-term system integrity.

My toolbox spans among others **Rust**, **Modern C++**, **Python** on **Linux**; on **FreeRTOS**, **Zephyr** and **RTIC**.
Current side project: a **low‑power LoRa mesh** for off‑grid data exchange.

**Technical Vision**: I specialize in designing **resilient connected systems** with an expertise in secure communication patterns, robust failure recovery, and security by design to help build systems that are reliable and secure even in challenging deployment environments.

# Selected Project Highlights
* **Fleet Edge Hub** - Rust‑based asynchronous data pipeline with MQTT cloud sync, resilient modem handling, connection diagnostics.
* **Mobile Chiller Gateway** - C++ on Ubuntu Core; Snap packaging, cellular connectivity, fleet‑wide orchestration, OTA update.
* **Automotive AOSP Gateway** - C++/Rust services, Binder IPC, SELinux hardening, third‑party framework integration, power‑management design.
* **Home EEG Wearable** - Buildroot board, on‑device data reduction, secure MQTT uplink.
* **VoIP Embedded Phone** - Yocto board, C++ based platform management, secure configuration provisioning, robust software and hardware watchdog development.
* **Carrier‑Grade Router Extension** - Linux kernel module extending IPv4/IPv6 stack for telecom router.

*(Further details available on request.)*

# Technical Leadership & Collaboration
* **Architecture Design** - Designed system architecture for distributed edge systems, event-driven systems. Designed service responsibilities and features, interfaces, and security.
* **Technical Leadership** - Led development of critical modules. Written technical requirements and specifications. Established integration workflow.
* **Cross-Functional Collaboration** - Collaborated with teams of hardware engineers, automation QA, and field testers. Collaborated in cross functional teams.
* **Engineering Mentorship** - Onboarded engineers. Refined commit patterns. Implemented code review practices and helped increase technical knowledge through different channels (code review, pair programming, tech talks).
* **Technical Standards** - Developed logging guidelines used by multiple teams of different domains. Designed and documented communication protocols used between teams.
* **Technical Interviewing** - Evaluated candidates during technical assessments. Helped improving the process.

# Core Toolkit

* **Testing** - GoogleTest • pytest • hardware‑in‑the‑loop (HIL) benches

# Example Challenges I Can Solve
* **Deploy a secure edge gateway** - Yocto BSP, TPM‑backed secure‑boot, certificates provisioning, encrypted A/B OTA, fleet rollout tooling
* **Add hard real‑time capability to existing firmware** - Add real-time patch to kernel, or FreeRTOS or Zephyr/RTIC board bring‑up, latency tuning
* **Design resilient field communications** - LoRa ↔ MQTT store‑and‑forward bridge, MQTT cloud hand‑off, adaptive bandwidth & cellular fallback
* **Build failure‑resilient IIoT devices** - Service confinement, watchdog, remote diagnostics, HIL stress tests
* **Edge data processing pipelines** - Data aggregation, compression, filtering on device to cut cloud traffic and enable edge-local decisions
