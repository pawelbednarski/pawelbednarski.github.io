**Embedded Linux** | **Secure Embedded Systems** | **Edge & IIoT Gateways** | **Real‑Time Firmware** | **Modern C++ & Rust**

I build the **software stack** that keeps connected machines running far from the cloud-
from **truck‑mounted chillers** and **fleet telematics hubs** to **medical wearables** and **industrial routers**.

My toolbox spans **Modern C++**, **Rust**, **Python** on **Linux**; on **FreeRTOS**, and **Zephyr** and **RTIC** prototypes.
Current side project: a **low‑power LoRa mesh** for off‑grid data exchange.

**My Specialization**: I focus on building **resilient connected systems** with expertise in communication patterns, failure recovery, and security by design to help build systems that are reliable and secure even in challenging deployment environments.

## Core Toolkit
* **OS / Firmware** - Yocto • Buildroot • Ubuntu Core • OpenWRT • Android AOSP • FreeRTOS • Zephyr • RTIC
* **Languages** - C • Modern C++ (11–20) • Rust • Python
* **Connectivity** - MQTT • ZeroMQ • gRPC • Redis PubSub • IPv6 • LoRa/LoRaWAN • cellular modem integration
* **IPC & Interfaces** - D‑Bus • Binder • POSIX message queues • shared memory • Netlink • UART • I²C • SPI • GPIO
* **Security** - Secure Boot • TPM • SELinux • Certificate workflows (CMP, AWS Claim) • Clippy & clang‑tidy static analysis
* **Debugging & Diagnostics** - gdb/gdbserver • core dump analysis • strace/ltrace • perf profiling • journalctl • syslog analysis • remote diagnostics • cross-compilation toolchains • post-mortem analysis • tcpdump/Wireshark • Valgrind
* **DevOps / Build** - CMake • Conan • Docker / docker‑compose • GitHub Actions • GitLab CI • Jenkins • TeamCity
* **Testing** - GoogleTest • pytest • hardware‑in‑the‑loop (HIL) benches

## Selected Project Highlights
* **Fleet Edge Hub** - Rust‑based asynchronous data pipeline with MQTT cloud sync, resilient modem handling, connection diagnostics.
* **Mobile Chiller Gateway** - C++ on Ubuntu Core; Snap packaging, cellular connectivity, fleet‑wide orchestration, OTA update.
* **Automotive AOSP Gateway** - C++/Rust services, Binder IPC, SELinux hardening, third‑party framework integration, power‑management design.
* **Home EEG Wearable** - Buildroot board, on‑device data reduction, secure MQTT uplink.
* **VoIP Embedded Phone** - Yocto board, C++ based platform management, secure configuration provisioning, robust software and hardware watchdog development.
* **Carrier‑Grade Router Extension** - Linux kernel module extending IPv4/IPv6 stack for telecom router.

## Technical Leadership & Collaboration
* **Architecture Design** - Designed system architecture for distributed edge systems, event-driven systems. Designed service responsibilities and features, interfaces, and security.
* **Technical Leadership** - Led development of critical modules. Written technical requirements and specifications. Established integration workflow.
* **Cross-Functional Collaboration** - Collaborated with teams of hardware engineers, automation QA, and field testers. Collaborated in cross functional teams.
* **Engineering Mentorship** - Onboarded engineers. Refined commit patterns. Implemented code review practices and helped increase technical knowledge through different channels (code review, pair programming, tech talks).
* **Technical Standards** - Developed logging guidelines used by multiple teams of different domains. Designed and documented communication protocols used between teams.
* **Technical Interviewing** - Evaluated candidates during technical assessments. Helped improving the process.

## Example Challenges I Can Solve
* **Deploy a secure edge gateway** - Yocto BSP, TPM‑backed secure‑boot, certificates provisioning, encrypted A/B OTA, fleet rollout tooling
* **Add hard real‑time capability to existing firmware** - Add real-time patch to kernel, or FreeRTOS or Zephyr/RTIC board bring‑up, latency tuning
* **Design resilient field communications** - LoRa ↔ MQTT store‑and‑forward bridge, MQTT cloud hand‑off, adaptive bandwidth & cellular fallback
* **Build failure‑resilient IIoT devices** - Service confinement, watchdog, remote diagnostics, HIL stress tests
* **Edge data processing pipelines** - Data aggregation, compression, filtering on device to cut cloud traffic and enable edge-local decisions

### Let's Work Together
Available for consulting and collaboration on embedded, IIoT, edge, or autonomous systems. Based in Poland (EU), or fully remote with cyclic visits onsite.
