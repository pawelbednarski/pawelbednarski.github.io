# Hello and Welcome

I'm Paweł, an embedded systems engineer that decided to show his work to the world. I became an engineer to build stuff that interacts with the Real World™, so embedded systems were the best option. I have worked on devices from IIoT truck solutions, through automotive gateways to medical devices, and decided to create this space to share technical and strategic insights from the labs.

## What You'll Find Here

This blog will focus on:
- Secure embedded architecture
- Failure resilient devices
- Hands-on build log
- Real-world solutions to devices working in demanding environments
- Technical deep-dives on embedded Linux, RTOS, and firmware development
- Strategic perspectives on embedded technology evolution
- Working my way towards autonomous devices

Whether you're an experienced embedded engineer or just exploring the domain, I hope you'll find something here. Questions and topic suggestions are very welcome!
